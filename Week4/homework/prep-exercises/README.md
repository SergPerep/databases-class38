# Prep exercise week 4

- What made you decide when to embed information? What assumptions did you make?
    > Embed in document data that can't be predefined.
- If you were given MySQL and MongoDB as choices to build the recipe's database at the beginning, which one would you choose and why?
    > MongDb. Since you can't predefine recipe steps and every user is going to write them differently.
